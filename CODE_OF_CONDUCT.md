# Code of Conduct
We expect all contributors and participants to adhere to the following code of conduct. This code of conduct outlines our expectations for behavior within the project community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## Our Standards
We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors and participants. We expect all members of our community to respect each other and conduct themselves in a professional and courteous manner.

Specifically, we do not tolerate:

- Harassment or discrimination of any kind, including but not limited to, age, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, religion, or national origin.
- Intimidating or threatening behavior, or any behavior that creates an unsafe environment for others.
- Disrespectful or derogatory comments, personal attacks, or any behavior that causes others to feel unwelcome or uncomfortable.
- Any form of dishonesty or unethical behavior.

# Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
We take all reports of unacceptable behavior seriously. Any member of the community who engages in unacceptable behavior may be asked to stop or leave the community, at the discretion of the project maintainers. In more serious cases, we may report the behavior to appropriate authorities.

## Reporting Unacceptable Behavior
If you witness or experience any behavior that violates this code of conduct, please report it immediately to the project maintainers. All reports will be kept confidential and will be reviewed.
